# Blank Screen Issue - FIXED ✓

## Problem Summary
After changing player behavior, the game showed a blank screen on startup.

## Root Cause
The `Player` class constructor was trying to load images from `/player/player1.png`, `/player/player2.png`, and `/player/player3.png`, but these resources were not found in the classpath at runtime, causing a `NullPointerException`.

The images were located in `src/main/resources/player/` but the compiled `.class` files were in the root directory, causing a resource path mismatch.

## Errors Fixed

### 1. **Missing Player Images in Classpath**
- **Error**: `java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "java.net.URL.toExternalForm()" because the return value of "java.lang.Class.getResource(String)" is null`
- **Location**: `Player.java:20`
- **Fix**: Created `player/` directory in root and copied images from `src/main/resources/player/` to `player/`

### 2. **Player Constructor - Extra Comma**
- **Error**: `illegal start of expression` at `Player.java:111`
- **Original**: `player = new Player(startX, startY,);`
- **Fixed**: `player = new Player(startX, startY, 20);`
- **Note**: Added missing `radius` parameter (20 pixels)

### 3. **Undefined Scene and GameMap Variables**
- **Error**: Multiple `cannot find symbol` errors for `scene` and `gameMap` variables
- **Location**: `GameScene.java:233-242`
- **Fix**: Removed invalid code block that referenced non-existent variables

### 4. **Missing Boolean Arrays for Movement**
- **Error**: `cannot find symbol` for `up`, `down`, `left`, `right` arrays
- **Location**: `GameScene.java:260-269`
- **Fix**: Added proper declarations before usage:
  ```java
  final boolean[] up = {false};
  final boolean[] down = {false};
  final boolean[] left = {false};
  final boolean[] right = {false};
  ```

### 5. **Missing JavaFX Module**
- **Error**: Multiple `IntegerProperty cannot be resolved` errors in `MarksManager.java`
- **Fix**: Added `javafx.base` module to compilation and runtime commands
- **Updated Command**: `--add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.media,javafx.base`

## Files Modified

1. **GameScene.java**
   - Fixed Player constructor call
   - Added missing boolean array declarations
   - Removed invalid code referencing undefined variables

2. **javac --module-path Cpathtojavafx-s.txt**
   - Added `javafx.base` to module list

3. **Project Structure**
   - Created `/player/` directory in root
   - Copied player PNG images to correct location

## Current Status
✓ Game compiles without errors
✓ Game runs and displays properly
✓ Player sprites load correctly
✓ Movement system works
✓ Puzzle doors display properly

## Notes
- Database warnings are expected if MySQL is not running (game uses fallback puzzles)
- JavaFX warnings about native access are normal for JavaFX 25 and can be ignored
