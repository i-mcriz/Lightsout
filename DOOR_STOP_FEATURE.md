# Door Stop Feature - Player Freeze at Puzzle Doors

## Summary
Implemented a feature where the player automatically stops at puzzle doors and must answer the question before being able to move again. After answering (correctly or incorrectly), the player can only resume movement by pressing a movement key (WASD or arrow keys).

## Feature Details

### Player Behavior at Doors:

1. **Approaching a Door:**
   - Player moves normally until they step on a door tile
   - When player reaches a door tile, they are **immediately frozen** in place
   - Puzzle window appears automatically

2. **While Puzzle is Active:**
   - Player cannot move at all (frozen state)
   - Movement keys have no effect during puzzle
   - Game loop continues running (no blocking)

3. **After Answering (Correct):**
   - Puzzle window closes
   - Door visual disappears (if solved correctly)
   - Player remains frozen at current position
   - **Player must press any movement key** (W/A/S/D or arrows) to unfreeze
   - Once unfrozen, player can move away from door normally

4. **After Answering (Wrong):**
   - Puzzle window closes
   - Player remains frozen at current position
   - **Player must press any movement key** to unfreeze
   - After unfrozen, final score screen appears
   - Game ends and returns to menu

## Implementation Details

### New State Variables:
```java
final boolean[] playerFrozen = {false};      // Freezes player movement
final boolean[] waitingForInput = {false};   // Waiting for keyboard input
```

### Key Press Handler Enhancement:
```java
finalScene.setOnKeyPressed(e -> {
    // Check if waiting for input after puzzle completion
    if (waitingForInput[0]) {
        if (movement key pressed) {
            waitingForInput[0] = false;
            playerFrozen[0] = false;
            // Player can now move
        }
    }
    // Regular movement key processing
});
```

### Game Loop Changes:
```java
// Movement only processed if player is not frozen
if (!playerFrozen[0]) {
    if (up[0]) dy -= speed;
    if (down[0]) dy += speed;
    if (left[0]) dx -= speed;
    if (right[0]) dx += speed;
    
    player.move(dx, dy, map);
}

// When door is reached
if (player on door tile) {
    playerFrozen[0] = true;  // Stop player immediately
    // Show puzzle...
    
    // After puzzle completion
    waitingForInput[0] = true;  // Wait for user input
    dialogOpen = false;
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### Correct Answer Flow:
```
1. Player walks to door
2. Player stops automatically ⛔
3. Puzzle appears 📋
4. Player answers correctly ✅
5. Door disappears 🚪➡️✨
6. Player is frozen, waiting for input ⏸️
7. Player presses W/A/S/D or arrow key ⌨️
8. Player unfreezes and can move 🏃
9. Continue to next door
```

### Wrong Answer Flow:
```
1. Player walks to door
2. Player stops automatically ⛔
3. Puzzle appears 📋
4. Player answers incorrectly ❌
5. Player is frozen, waiting for input ⏸️
6. Player presses any movement key ⌨️
7. Player unfreezes briefly
8. Final score screen appears 📊
9. Game ends and returns to menu
```

## Technical Benefits

✅ **No Accidental Movement** - Player can't accidentally walk away during puzzle
✅ **Controlled Pacing** - Forces player to acknowledge puzzle result before continuing
✅ **Better User Feedback** - Clear pause after each puzzle completion
✅ **Intentional Progression** - Player must actively choose to continue
✅ **Non-Blocking** - Game loop continues, animations still work
✅ **Responsive** - Any movement key unfreezes (not just one specific key)

## Code Locations

**File: `GameScene.java`**
- Lines ~232-250: Key press handler with unfreeze logic
- Lines ~265-275: Movement processing with freeze check
- Lines ~281-350: Door detection and freeze/unfreeze logic

## Testing Scenarios

1. ✅ Walk to door - player should stop
2. ✅ Try to move during puzzle - should not move
3. ✅ Answer correctly - door disappears, player frozen
4. ✅ Press W/A/S/D - player unfreezes
5. ✅ Answer incorrectly - player frozen
6. ✅ Press arrow key - player unfreezes, then final score shows
7. ✅ Multiple doors in sequence - each should freeze/unfreeze properly

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- Visual indicator when player is frozen (e.g., different color, glow effect)
- Text prompt: "Press any movement key to continue"
- Sound effect when player freezes/unfreezes
- Freeze animation (player pulses or flashes)
- Countdown timer showing "Press key in 3...2...1..." before auto-continuing
